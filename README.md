# GANs
Pytorch implementation of DCGAN & CGAN.

## CGAN
The goal is to train the CGAN on a dataset of hands and metadata (color, gender, accessories, ..).
The CGAN is conditioned on this information regarding the corresponding hand image, e.g. gender or color, so that it could generate hands based on gender and/or color.
